# Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to the field of Computer Graphics. 
We will cover the basic mathematical concepts, such as 2D and 3D transformations, study the interaction of light with geometry to derive shading models, and implement rendering algorithms such as ray tracing and rasterization. 
We will investigate how these fundamental components are integrated in current graphics processors and study the corresponding programming APIs.

# Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, the students will design, program, and analyze algorithms and systems for interactive 3D shape modeling and digital geometry processing.

To set up an environment for the projects, please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/teseoch/CG-Spring-2023/blob/main/Rules.md)
