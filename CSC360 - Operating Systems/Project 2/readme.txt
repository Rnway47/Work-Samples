After unzipping p3.tar.gz file, run "make" command to compile diskinfo.c, disklist.c, diskget.c, and diskput.c

To run these programs, follow the instructions in p3.pdf (assignment instructions)

For diskinfo, run it as ./diskinfo disk.IMA (or any disk image files with .IMA extension)
For disklist, run it as ./disklist disk.IMA (or any disk image files with .IMA extension)
For diskget, run it as ./diskget disk.IMA (or any disk image files with .IMA extension) filenames (file names are not case sensitive, ex. ANS1.PDF and ans1.pdf will have the same result)
For diskget, run it as ./diskput disk.IMA (or any disk image files with .IMA extension) filenames (file names are not case sensitive, ex. ANS1.PDF and ans1.pdf will have the same result)
                    or ./diskput disk.IMA (or any disk image files with .IMA extension) filepath
