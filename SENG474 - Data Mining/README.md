# Objectives
* Discover **stats/combinations of stats** that could reliably point to whether a player would become an all-star level player

## Procedures
* Used and modified a dataset of the stats of every year of every NBA playerâ€™s career combined with a list of the winners of every major award (https://github.com/swar/nba_api) - Contribution done by my teammate
* **Preprocessing** dataset - My contribution
  - fill empty cells
  - split into **numerical** and **categorical** attributes
  - scale data
  - pipeline data, fit, and transform
* Compare different **regression** methods and evaluate using the best regression method for each case - My contribution
* Find possible **correlation** of statistical attributes to each major award - Collaboration between my teammate and I
